Step 1: Write a Test

-Identify a specific requirement or functionality to test
-Write a test that covers the desired behavior
-The test should be independent of the implementation details

Step 2: Run the Test and See it Fail

-Run the test to ensure it fails (since no code has been written yet)
-This step verifies that the test is actually testing the desired behavior

Step 3: Write the Code

-Write the minimal amount of code necessary to pass the test
-Focus on making the test pass, rather than writing perfect code
-Refactor the code to make it maintainable and efficient

Step 4: Run the Test and See it Pass

-Run the test again to ensure it passes
-Verify that the code meets the desired behavior

Step 5: Refactor the Code

-Refactor the code to make it more maintainable, efficient, and easy to understand
-Remove any duplication or unnecessary complexity
-Benefits of TDD

-Bug Reduction: Writing tests before code helps catch bugs early, reducing the overall number of bugs in the system
-Faster Development: TDD helps developers focus on the required functionality, reducing the time spent on debugging and rework
-Improved Code Quality: TDD promotes writing clean, modular, and maintainable code
-Increased Confidence: TDD gives developers confidence in their code, reducing the fear of making changes
Better Design: TDD encourages developers to think about the design and architecture of the system, leading to a better overall design
