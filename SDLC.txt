 Gather and document requirements
 Importance: Lays foundation for entire project
 Output: Requirements document

**Design**
 Translate requirements into technical specifications
 Create architecture, components, and interfaces
 Plan for scalability, security, and performance
 Importance: Ensures solution meets requirements and is feasible
 Output: Design document

**Implementation**
 Write code, develop software, and integrate components
 Use programming languages, tools, and frameworks
 Conduct unit testing and debugging
 Importance: Brings design to life and creates working software
 Output: Working software

**Testing**
 Verify software meets requirements and works as expected
 Identify and fix defects and bugs
 Conduct various types of testing (unit, integration, system)
 Importance: Ensures software quality and reliability
